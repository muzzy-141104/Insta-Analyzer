This is for every inch of effort left on the field playing for this team.

It’s tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I’ll carry for life.\n\nThere’s something deeply personal about playing in whites. The quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no one sees but that stay with you forever.\n\nAs I step away from this format, it’s not easy — but it feels right. I’ve given it everything I had, and it’s given me back so much more than I could’ve hoped for.\n\nI’m walking away with a heart full of gratitude — for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way.\n\nI’ll always look back at my Test career with a smile.\n\n#269, signing off.\n🇮🇳❤️",
